 <p>Welcome to SKIIwalker-web</p>

    <p>
        Simple Kean Interactive Information - or SKIIwalker, is a mobile application used for displaying information
        based on the application user's current position. SKIIwalker uses GIS or geographic information systems to detect
        when a user enters a building and will display relevant information and events to the user through the mobile
        application. It is our hope that SKIIwalker will help to streamline mobile distribution of event data throughout the
        Kean Union campus.

    <p>
        This is the administrative web application for SKIIwalker where administrators can enter event details that the SKIIwalker
        mobile application will display to users. SKIIwalker-web is backed by a MongoDB database and was built on top of the
        <a href="https://github.com/rdash/rdash-angular" target="_blank">RDash-angular</a> dashboard boilerplate.
